		<H2>Reasons of the Application</H2>
		<H3>
			The application called "Search Tourism Madrid" is intended mainly for tourist, although 
			we think and hope, could be an useful tool for "Madrileños". Some questions which are the reason 
			and the starting of this application are:
			<UL>
				<LI>What happens if somebody comes Madrid and have a short period of time, so he couldn't 
					move from one place to another with large distances?</LI>
				<LI>If a tourist need to do something in his embassy or consulated, but then he need to 
					wait or has time, He could approach to visit an interesting place, but... Where 
					does he need to go? How to know it?</LI>
				<LI>A Madrileño has been living all his life in a neighborhood, and he knows there are 
					touristic places around him, How to know the information of these places?</LI>
			</UL>

		<H2>Description of the Interface</H2>
		<H3>
			The user only needs to write the place, building, embassy, consulated (by now, we hope any 
			touristic place	in the future) into the "Search" section, so the application shows its data, as 
			address, street or avenue, district, coordenates, subway stations near, etc. Besides these 
			information, it is show the map, I mean the localization in a geographic area.
			<P>
			If the tourist would like to know which other places are over there, he only needs go to "Near 
			Places (Optional)" and choose one of the options. If he choose "Neighborhood", "District" or 
			"Postal Code", the information increase, showing the data of its places situated near of the 
			research. The maps change, giving the localizations of those places in a "Neighborhood", 
			"District" or the "Postal Code".
